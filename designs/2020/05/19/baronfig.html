                    I wanted to start with the color first. I felt that the
                    current maroon/fig/wine color was a little too muted. I
                    started by increasing the saturation and using that base
                    color to influence the other colors within the palette. I
                    brought more color to the yellow to give it more of a gold
                    look. Inspiration for these colors came from their notebook
                    selection. For the black color, I wanted to make it less
                    jarring and lighten in up a bit.

                <p class="content__project__desc">
                    For their logo I wanted to create some sort of icon that
                    related to either what they do or a logo based on their
                    name. The final logo came out to be a B wrapped within a fig
                    outline shape (mildy NSFW). Overall I think the logo came
                    out how I envisioned it and would want to explore color
                    variations on actual products such as notebooks or pens.
